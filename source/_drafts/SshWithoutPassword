a@A:~> ssh b@B mkdir -p .ssh
b@B's password:
Finally append a's new public key to b@B:.ssh/authorized_keys and enter b's password one last time:

a@A:~> cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh b@B 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
b@B's password:
From now on you can log into B as b from A as a without password:

a@A:~> ssh b@B
